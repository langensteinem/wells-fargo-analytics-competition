<p>220,377 posts, and two weeks to figure them all out. These are very intimidating numbers for a team of freshman with zero experience in the data science world. How does one even start something like this? The first step was to outline potential approaches. After several scrapped ideas, the final was to focus on each bank individually. To do this, we found data points containing “banka”, “bankb”, “bankc”, and “bankd”, and categorized them accordingly. Our next step was divide each bank’s posts based on their sentiment, ie. the post’s attitude, positive or negative. To find the sentiments of each data point, we used a list of positive words and a list a negative words. We compared the words in each data point to the words of the lists, and a score was recorded for each post. If a post contained a positive word, its score went up by one, and if a post contained a negative word, its score went down by one. Posts with scores above two were marked as positive, and posts with scores below negative two were marked as negative. 
So, at this point, the data points have been divided into eight groups: a positive and negative group for each of the four banks. However, not every post from the original data set is a part of one of these groups. Any post that does not mention any of the banks or has a middling sentiment was removed. Also, if a post mentioned two or more of the banks, it was placed in multiple groups.
Now, to determine the subject matters of the posts, we looked at each group as a large body of text. Within each of these bodies, we found the most frequently used words. This gave us some overall topics to look at for each group, instead of classifying each post individually.
Below is an outline of our thought process when approaching this project.</p>
